<h3> About Me </h3>

		<p class ="content"> Ever since my best friend started learning Java in elementary school, computer science has surrounded me. At first, I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the field;
		But as soon as I started learning CS myself early on in high school, I quickly reaized that my strengths in math and logic perfectly correlated. 
		In the next four years, I took CS courses in Java, Python and C while developing a strong foundation in the fundamentals of design, algorithms, and
		data structures. </p> <br>

		<p class = "content"> But now, I'm excited to take my knowledge base and apply it to applicatons. As a budding college freshman, I'm surrounded in a world of start ups and 
		hackathons. Everything changes so quickly in this innovative age so I'm still not sure if CS is all that I hope to do, but I'm not afraid to explore. </p> <br>

		<p class = "content"> Outside of school, I also love to listen to music (combination of pop, electronic, rap, and classical), write, and follow basketball, some of which
		are featured below! </p> <br>
